# UNDP Conflict & Food Insecurity Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between political violence and food insecurity using publicly available UNDP and conflict datasets, with a focus on temporal and regional trends.

## Tools
R, tidyverse, ggplot2, tmap, shiny, geoplot, RStudio

## Key Work
- Cleaned and merged large socio-economic and conflict datasets
- Analyzed temporal and geographic patterns in political violence and food prices
- Built visualizations to highlight correlations and regional disparities

## Why It Matters
This project applied data wrangling, analysis, and visualization techniques to real-world UNDP and conflict datasets, requiring robust cleaning pipelines, dataset integration, and reproducible analysis. Working with noisy, large-scale data strengthened my ability to transform raw information into interpretable insights through code, not manual analysis. The project demonstrates how technical tooling can be used to analyze complex real-world systems with reliability and clarity.
